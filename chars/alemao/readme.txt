Arno*cough*T-8P 0.9 from Battle K-Road by The_None

In the future computers control the world while humans struggle to survive and overthrow the opressive machine regime.  As John Connor leads the human rebellion he captures T8P and reprograms him to serve mankind.  He then sends T8P back in time to protect his past self from time traveling assassins.  The time machine malfunctions and sends T8P to a prehistoric age where the evil warlock Thulsa Doom subjugates humanity with an iron fist.  After quickly dispatching him and earning the title of "Conan", T8P hibernates and is rudely awoken in the mid 1980's when a mysterious alien lifeform arrives on Earth.  Conscripted into the US military, he becomes the only survivor of a doomed jungle combat operation when the group encounters the alien predator.  After a long battle the alien is finally defeated as T8P escapes in a helicopter while it self destructs.  T8P can no longer hibernate, so he finds himself fighting random people to pass time while John Connor is still not born yet.

He can juggle up to three times (some moves are extempt from this), and few of his moves cannot be juggled into themselves.
