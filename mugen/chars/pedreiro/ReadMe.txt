Rhino is a copy written character by Marvel


Well, this would be the first BETA release of Rhino. Plenty of more things are coming for this guy, so stay tuned.

This would also be a bit of a rushed "read me" so, sorry if I miss anyone. XD
==============================================================
Special Thanks:

MGMurrow - Ofcourse, first and foremost, thanks to MG. Without this guy, none of this would be happening. Even if it were, it probably wouldn't of been as great as this guy does some of my favorite coding. Like a thousand thanks over to him and will try my best to help him out whenever he needs it. =D

ShockDingo - This is the second guy I owe plenty of thanks to. One of the nicest guys I've ever met and with a lot of vocal talent. Nailed the perfect voice for Rhino on his first try and he kept empressing me more and more with everything he sent. In this release you won't be hearing too many vocals, sadly, but by next release, that'll be changing. =P

tattooedfreak - For all the badass portraits he made for Rhino. =D

Kong - Zangief sprite rips (MvC/CvS).

POTS - A good amount of his Open Source stuff.

Wucash - Cop Car sprites from his Ghost Rider w/alterations by myself.

Camo - For the original nail design on Rhino. Not sure how that part would of come out if I hadn't of mimiced his style.

Lastly, and most importantly, IMT in general. With plenty of positive words and encouragement, it kept me going day in and day out on him. Thank you all, epecially Acey and Excursion. =)
